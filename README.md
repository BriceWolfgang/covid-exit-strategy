# Covid Exit Strategy

This repository includes the source code for generating data for [covidexitstrategy.org](https://www.covidexitstrategy.org/).

There are functions for extracting the data from a variety of sources, transforming and enriching it, and then finally
loading it into a Google Sheet which serves as the database backing the website.
