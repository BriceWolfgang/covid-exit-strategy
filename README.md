# Covid Exit Strategy

This repository includes the source code for generating data for [covidexitstrategy.org](https://www.covidexitstrategy.org/).

There are functions for extracting the data from a variety of sources, transforming and enriching it, and then finally
loading it into a Google Sheet which serves as the database backing the website.

The documents for this project are kept in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1NRgsCay6XvmZ8Qsj53aK0IFvTfN-CFwD).

The data for the website currently comes from [this workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZhwP0GZTz50myibSaWsMXOVQKx9DQaJO4rN1i58Rrjc/edit#gid=712897421),
which also includes tabs that Ryan refreshes on a regular basis with updated copied data.

The meaning of the CDC criteria are spelled out in our interpretation in [this workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1q9yZaQ1_qwEecvYknS1sZsRbD6eDY7il_uIX2dInbr0/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=109155667631110887569).
